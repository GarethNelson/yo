requirements:
  1 - only one active follower at a time
  2 - if the active follower times out, another follower should take over
  3 - must not spam the DB or constantly fill a DB table

each iteration:
  if not active, determine if active node has crashed
  if active, do work and update timestamp

if active:
   lock status table
   verify follower ID is ours, if not set ourselves to inactive
   start tx
    insert notifications
    update blockchain status table
   commit tx
   unlock status table

if not active:
   sleep for id%9 seconds
   query blockchain status table
   if last_processed_timestamp is further back than block interval*3:
      try to lock blockchain status table, on failure go back to sleep
      once locked:
        update blockchain status table with own ID
        set local active flag true
        do active iteration
        unlock

blockchain status table:
  single row
    active_follower_id
    last_processed_timestamp
    last_processed_block
